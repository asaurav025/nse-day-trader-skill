  Budget Manager. Sizes every position to your budget and your max loss per
  trade, in rupees. Reads the trade plan from trader-exit (entry, stop,
  target), rounds every price to the NSE tick of ₹0.05, finds the whole shares
  that fit inside four limits (max loss per trade, position cap, max order,
  cash after your buffer), says which limit decided it, and writes ONE
  proposed order (entry, stop-loss, take-profit) to trader/orders.json for
  trader-broker's ticket. A stop too far away for your max loss is a plain
  refusal, not a smaller order. Nothing is placed. Use when the user says "how
  many shares", "size this trade", "how much should I buy", "I have
  ₹1,00,000", "I only want to risk ₹1,000 a trade", "set my rules", "keep 10%
  in cash", or after /trader-exit writes a plan.

# trader-budget

The Budget Manager turns a plan ("buy RELIANCE at 1,174.30, stop 1,166.20")
into an exact order ("buy 63 shares"), inside rules the user sets once. The
stop decides the size: the further away the stop, the fewer shares. It writes
a proposal only. trader-risk checks it and trader-broker asks the user yes or
no. Intraday trading loses most people money. Sizing to a max loss keeps each
loss small; it does not make a trade win.

`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` below is this skill's folder (where this SKILL.md lives).

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/size.py"                         # trader/plan.json + trader/config.json
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/size.py" --write                 # write trader/orders.json
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/size.py" --limit --write         # a limit order at the plan's entry
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/size.py" --limit 1174.30 --json  # a limit order at 1,174.30
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/size.py" --weights RELIANCE=60,TCS=40 --prices trader/prices.json --config split.json
```

`--now "2026-10-29 10:15"` pins the clock (IST). A plan for another day is
refused: make a new one with trader-exit.

## What it reads and writes

| file | what |
| --- | --- |
| `trader/config.json` | the rules (start from `config.example.json` in this folder) |
| `trader/plan.json` | the trade: entry, stop, target, setup, flat-by time (trader-exit writes it) |
| `trader/prices.json` | optional: a fresh price above the plan's entry means a bigger risk (trader-alerts writes it) |
| `trader/portfolio.json` | optional: its cash caps the size (trader-broker keeps it) |
| `trader/orders.json` | the one proposed order it writes with `--write` |

## Step 1: set the rules once

If `trader/config.json` does not exist, copy `config.example.json` into
`trader/config.json` and ask the user for each value in plain words. Every
amount is in rupees:

- **budget**: how much money this is for (example ₹1,00,000). Only money they can afford to lose.
- **cash_buffer_pct**: how much always stays in cash (default 10).
- **max_loss_per_trade_inr**: the most one trade may lose if the stop fills at the stop (default ₹1,000).
- **max_position_pct**, **max_order_inr**, **min_order_inr**: the biggest position (75% of the
  budget), the biggest order (₹75,000) and the smallest order (₹500).
- The day limits trader-risk enforces: **max_daily_loss_inr** (₹3,000), **max_trades_per_day** (3),
  **min_reward_risk** (1.0), **require_stop** (true), **no_entries_before** / **no_entries_after**
  ("09:30" / "14:45") and **flat_by** ("15:10"), all IST. Zerodha squares off open intraday
  (MIS) positions from about 15:20, so flat_by stays before that.
- **blocked**: NSE symbols they never want to trade.

A config that still has a dollar key (`max_loss_per_trade_usd` and the like) is refused with
the new name to use: a dollar amount read as rupees would be off by about 85 times.

## Step 2: size the trade

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/size.py" --write
```

Whole shares only: NSE equity has no fractional shares. Every price is
rounded to the ₹0.05 tick first (NSE rejects anything else), and the math uses
the rounded prices. The size is the smallest of four limits:

| limit | shares |
| --- | --- |
| max loss | `max_loss_per_trade_inr` / risk a share (entry minus stop) |
| position cap | budget x `max_position_pct` / entry |
| max order | `max_order_inr` / entry |
| cash | (budget minus the cash buffer) / entry, never more than the cash in `trader/portfolio.json` |

The entry it sizes at: the limit price with `--limit`. For a market order, the
plan's entry, or the price in `trader/prices.json` if it is fresh (under 15
minutes old) and higher. A price that ran up since the plan means a bigger
loss at the same stop, so fewer shares. A lower price never shrinks the risk.

It refuses, and writes no order, when: the size is zero shares, the order is
under the minimum, reward:risk is under `min_reward_risk`, the stop is not
below the entry, the target is not above it (the move already happened), the
plan is for another day, the symbol is blocked or not an NSE symbol, or the
plan is a short. Say the reason to the user in one line.

## Step 3: show the user

Show the four limits, which one decided the size, the shares, the rupees and
the max loss at the stop. Say plainly that a stop is an order, not a promise:
in a fast market it can fill below the stop, and a stock locked at its circuit
limit may not trade at all. Then hand over to `/trader-risk`.

## Example: the reel

RELIANCE on Thursday 2026-10-29. Opening-range breakout: entry 1,174.30 at
9:40 AM, stop 1,166.20, target 1,190.50 (2R). Risk 8.10 a share. The example
config: ₹1,00,000 budget, 10% cash buffer, ₹1,000 max loss.

| limit | the math | shares |
| --- | --- | --- |
| max loss | ₹1,000 / 8.10 | 123 |
| position cap | 75% of ₹1,00,000 = ₹75,000 / 1,174.30 | **63 (decides it)** |
| max order | ₹75,000 / 1,174.30 | 63 |
| cash | ₹1,00,000 minus ₹10,000 = ₹90,000 / 1,174.30 | 76 |

63 shares = ₹73,980.90. Max loss at the stop: 63 x 8.10 = ₹510.30. It writes
one proposed order with the entry, the stop-loss (1166.20) and the take-profit
(1190.50), a `why` ("opening-range breakout on RELIANCE: 63 shares, bound by
your position cap (63 x 8.10 = ₹510.30 at the stop)") and the `plan`.
trader-broker turns it into the order ticket; `why` and `plan` are notes for
trader-risk and trader-broker and are never sent to the broker.

With the stop at 1,160.00 instead, the risk is 14.30 a share and the max loss
69 shares, so the position cap still decides at 63 (₹900.90 at the stop). If
the price has run to 1,180.40 by 10:55, the same plan is measured from there:
risk 14.20 a share and reward:risk 0.71, refused, because the move it was
waiting for has mostly happened.

## Weights mode (kept from v1)

`--weights RELIANCE=30,HDFCBANK=25` or `--targets FILE` (`targets.example.json`
here: illustrative weights, not a recommendation) splits a budget across a list
by weight: the cash buffer comes off the top, weights are renormalised to 100,
any stock over `max_position_pct` is pinned at the cap and its excess shared
out, slices under the minimum order are dropped, and each slice is bought in
whole shares, so it needs a price for every symbol (`--prices
trader/prices.json`). These are plain buys with no stop: trader-risk blocks them
while `require_stop` is true and counts each one against `max_trades_per_day`.
Use a separate config (`--config`) for a long-term split.

## Rules

- Proposals only. This skill never calls a broker tool.
- Never size money the user has not said is for this. Ask for the budget and the max loss.
- Every number comes from the config, the plan or the prices. Nothing is guessed.
- No projections: never say what a trade will make. A target is a plan, not a forecast.
- Free Yahoo prices are unofficial and can lag. The broker's price is the one that fills.

## What it never does

It never places, approves or schedules an order, never raises a limit on its
own, never shrinks a stop to fit more shares, and never sizes F&O, margin or
short positions.

## Safety

- Education and tooling, not financial advice. A PASS is a rules check, not a recommendation.
- Paper trading by default (`"paper": true`). Going live is the user's own decision, in their own config.
- Nothing in this pack places an order except trader-broker, and only when all three hold: trader-risk
  passed that exact order today, the user typed an explicit yes for that one order in the chat, and the
  user clicked Allow once on Claude's own card because the order tool is set to "Needs approval"
  (Customize > Connectors > tool permissions). Never set an order tool to "Always allow".
- No F&O, ever (out of scope). No margin, short selling or leverage unless the config allows it and the
  user confirms.
- Broker keys live on the broker's server (see trader-broker), never in the chat.
