  Time Machine. Replays every possible outcome of a trade before you risk a
  rupee: 10,000 simulated sessions plus every past time the setup fired.
  Takes the plan from trader-exit (entry, stop, target), rebuilds the rest of
  the day 10,000 times from the stock's own 5-minute NSE bars over the last
  60 days, and re-runs the same rule on every past session. Prints the odds
  of target first, stop first, or neither by the flat-by time (15:10 IST),
  where the price sits then, the average R, the history, and one honest
  verdict, then hands off to /trader-budget. Use when the user says "run the
  time machine", "replay this trade", "what are the odds", "simulate this
  trade", "monte carlo", "backtest this setup", "how often does this hit the
  target", "is this a coin flip", or after /trader-exit writes a plan, before
  /trader-budget.

# trader-timemachine

The Time Machine sits between the plan and the money. trader-exit has set
the entry, the stop and the target. Before anything is sized or sent, this
skill asks one question: if today plays out like the stock's own last 60
days, how often does this plan hit the target first, the stop first, or
neither? It answers with 10,000 replays and with the real record of the same
rule on every past session. It is a simulation built from the stock's own
recent bars, not a prediction. Day trading loses most people money, and a
good-looking replay does not change that.

`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` below is this skill's folder (where this SKILL.md lives).

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/timemachine.py" run                    # trader/plan.json, 10,000 replays, seed 19
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/timemachine.py" run --write            # also save trader/timemachine.json
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/timemachine.py" run --until 14:30      # end each replay earlier than flat_by
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/timemachine.py" run --json
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/timemachine.py" run --symbol RELIANCE --date 2026-10-29 \
    --entry 1174.30 --stop 1163.35 --target 1185.25 --entry-time "9:40 AM"
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/timemachine.py" chart --from           # ASCII fan chart of the saved run
```

Symbols are bare NSE symbols (`RELIANCE`, `M&M`, `BAJAJ-AUTO`; `.NS` is
optional). Other flags: `--replays N`, `--seed N` (default 19), `--window N`
(default 2 bars), `--offline PATH` (a saved Yahoo chart JSON, `.json` or
`.json.gz`, or a folder of `<SYMBOL>-60d5m.json`), `--now "2026-10-29 10:15"`
(IST) to pin the clock.

## What it reads and writes

| file | what |
| --- | --- |
| `trader/plan.json` | the plan from trader-exit: symbol, date, entry, entry_time / entry_bar, stop, stop_rule, target, target_r, opening range, flat_by |
| Yahoo chart API | one request: 60 days of 5-minute bars for `<SYMBOL>.NS` (`range=60d&interval=5m`), free and unofficial, can lag |
| `trader/timemachine.json` | with `--write`: `{plan, mc, history}` plus the verdict. `mc` holds the odds, percentiles, the fan-chart bands, 160 sample paths and a 24-bin histogram of the price at flat_by |

## How it works

1. **The day ends at flat_by.** The plan's `flat_by` (15:10 IST by default).
   Intraday (MIS) positions are squared off by Zerodha from about 15:20, and
   Yahoo sends the 15:20 bar of NSE stocks with no prices every day (often
   15:15 too), so no session is ever complete to the 15:30 close. Bars after
   flat_by are ignored and `--until` cannot be later than it.
2. **The pool.** It keeps only FULL sessions before the plan's date: every
   five-minute bar from 9:15 up to the bar that closes at flat_by (71 bars
   for 15:10). Gaps and today are left out. Every bar becomes four ratios to
   the bar before it: open, high, low and close over the previous close.
3. **One replay.** Start at the entry price. For each bar left in the day,
   pick a past bar from the same time of day (plus or minus 2 bars) at
   random, and scale it to the current price. Bar by bar, it checks the stop
   first, then the target. A bar that touches both counts as the stop.
4. **10,000 replays** give four odds. Target first. Stop first. Neither,
   which means the trade was still open at `--until` (default flat_by, when
   it is closed at that bar's close). Green, which means target first or
   above the entry at `--until`. R is +1 at a 1R target, -1 at the stop, and
   otherwise the distance from the entry at `--until` divided by the risk. A
   gap through the stop still counts as -1R here. A real fill can be worse.
5. **The history.** The plan's own rule (the same opening range, stop rule
   and target R) runs again on every one of those past sessions, with
   entries, stops and targets on the 0.05 tick like trader-exit's. That is
   what really happened, not a simulation.
6. **The verdict** is one line from the numbers. It looks only at the
   replays that hit one side, and asks how often the target came first. A
   bigger target needs to win less often to break even: 1 in (1 + R). That
   is 50 % at 1R, 33 % at 2R, 25 % at 3R. Less than 5 points from break-even:
   "Close to a coin flip" at 1R, "Close to break-even" at any other R. 5 to
   15 points: "Leans toward the target" or "Leans toward the stop". 15 or
   more: "Strongly toward" one of them. So a 2R plan with target first
   24.1 % and stop first 50.5 % is close to break-even (it needs 33 % of
   the 74.6 % that hit a side, and got 32 %), not a loser.
7. **Below the verdict**, when it applies: a line when more than 40 % of the
   replays hit neither (the price at `--until` decides those), and the
   average R when its sign goes against the lean. Those can only point the
   other way because of the replays that hit neither.

**The seed.** The draws come from Python's `random.Random(seed)`, seed 19 by
default. Same plan, same data, same seed: the same numbers, on any machine.
Say the seed with every result so the user can repeat it.

**5-minute bars only.** Yahoo keeps 60 days of 5-min bars but only about 7
days of 1-min bars, too few sessions for a fair pool. It refuses, in one
plain line, when there are fewer than 20 full sessions, when the entry bar is
not in the data (wrong date, not closed yet, a future day), or when the plan
does not make sense (a stop above a buy's entry, an entry off the 5-minute
grid, an entry too close to flat_by). A live in-progress bar is never used.

## Steps

1. Make sure `trader/plan.json` is today's plan from `/trader-exit`. If there
   is none, run that first, or pass the plan as flags.
2. Run `timemachine.py run --write`. The replays already end at the plan's
   flat_by, so "neither" means still open at the time you would get out.
3. Tell the user, in this order: the four odds, the median and the 5 to 95
   range of the price at flat_by, the average R, the history line, then the
   verdict line and any line under it exactly as printed. Say the seed.
4. If the verdict is a coin flip or close to break-even, say so plainly. Do
   not dress it up. If the history and the replays disagree, say that too.
5. Say once that this is built from the last 60 days and is not a prediction.
   Results, news, circuit limits and trading halts can do things those 60
   days never did. Check `/trader-news` for the stock before going on.
6. If the user still wants the trade, hand off to `/trader-budget` to size it.

## Example: the reel

RELIANCE, Thursday 2026-10-29 (real NSE bars). The 15-minute opening range is
1,156.20 to 1,170.50. The 9:35 bar closes above it: entry 1,174.30 at 9:40 AM
(bar 4), stop 1,163.35 (the range midpoint), target 1,185.25 (1R, risk 10.95
a share).

```
10,000 replays of the rest of the day, 9:40 AM to 3:10 PM (66 five-minute bars; flat by 3:10 PM), seed 19.
  target first   24.1 %
  stop first     31.4 %
  neither        44.5 %   still open at 3:10 PM
  green          44.5 %   target first, or above the entry at 3:10 PM
  Price at 3:10 PM: median ₹1,172.57, 90 % of replays between ₹1,156.07 and ₹1,189.23.
  Average R: -0.096 (R = the ₹10.95 risk: +1R at the target, -1R at the stop).
History: the same rule (15-min opening range, stop at the opening-range midpoint, 1R target) on each of
those 57 real sessions fired 27 times: 13 target, 11 stop, 3 neither. Average R +0.037.
Leans toward the stop: target first 24.1 % vs stop first 31.4 %.
44.5 % of the replays hit neither by 3:10 PM; the price at 3:10 PM decides those.
```

At 1R the target has to come first in half of the replays that hit one
side. It did in 43 %. The replays lean toward the stop, while the real
history of the same rule was slightly better than even. Both go to the user,
plainly, before `/trader-budget` sizes anything.

## Rules

- Every number comes from the run. Never round a coin flip up into an edge.
- The verdict line and the lines under it are printed by the tool. Repeat
  them, do not rewrite them. Never judge a 2R or 3R plan by target first vs
  stop first alone: the verdict already weighs the target's R.
- Simulated odds are not predictions and not promises. Say it once, plainly.
- Free Yahoo data is unofficial and can lag. Bars are 5-minute bars, checked
  bar by bar, never tick by tick and never real time.
- Always say the seed, so any run can be repeated.
- One plan per run. A changed entry, stop, target or date is a new run.

## What it never does

It never places an order, never sizes a position, never changes the plan,
and never calls a result a sure thing. It never prints a P&L or a profit.
It never uses a bar that has not closed yet, and never mixes today's bars
into the pool.

## Safety

- Education and tooling, not financial advice. A PASS is a rules check, not a recommendation.
- Dry run by default (`"dry_run": true`): Zerodha has no paper account, so trader-broker shows the
  ticket and places nothing. Going live is the user's own decision, in their own config.
- Nothing in this pack places an order except trader-broker, and only when all three hold: trader-risk
  passed that exact order today, the user typed an explicit yes for that one order in the chat, and the
  user approved Claude's own "Needs approval" prompt for the Kite order tool. Never set an order tool
  to "Always allow".
- No F&O, margin, short selling or leverage beyond Zerodha's standard intraday (MIS) product.
- Kite keys live only in the MCP server's environment on the user's VPS, never in the chat.
